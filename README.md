# Simple-Moving-Average
Created a program to calculate the simple moving average for a specified stock over a particular time period and window for the average. This was mostly for practice using dataframes, matplotlib, and acquiring stock data from https://www.quandl.com/. Moving averages can be found pretty easily from websites like Yahoo Finance.
